# Soft-compression
An joint-source coding method for image
  
These are the codes for soft compression, you can run main.py to use it on MNIST dataset


Module-1: Preprocess.py

    Preprocessing the input set of images and then divide it into training set and testing set

Module-2: CodeFinding.py

    search the frequency of the set of shapes

Module-3: CodeProcessing.py

    Use Huffman-coding for the set of shapes

Module-4: Encode.py

    Encode the image

Module-5: Decode.py

    decode the compressed date to restore the original image
